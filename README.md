Set of differnt tools usefull for players of Alien Worlds game

 - listMinesOnLand -> based on the configuration you are able for example to check all the miners on a specific land, or check a single miner's mines across all the lands he mined, etc. 
 - minerStats -> check some statistics of a particular miner - average TLM, mine count. +2 charts with: mine amount vs time, and histogram of mine delays (useful to see if the account is a bot or a human).  
It also shows the miner's bag in human readable format.
